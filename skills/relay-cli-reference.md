# Relay swarm CLI reference

Shared by the relay-worker and relay-coordinator skills. All verbs resolve
"me" from $ITERM_SESSION_ID automatically - run them via the Bash tool from
inside your session. Errors print to stderr with a non-zero exit.

    relay register --name <name> --role worker|coordinator [--project <p>]
        Bind this session to a swarm name. Re-running rebinds (safe).

    relay status "<one line>"
        Update your status line (shown in the relay TUI). Keep it fresh.

    relay send <name> "<body>"
        Queue a message for a named session. It is TYPED INTO their Claude
        prompt when they are idle and the relay TUI is running. Single line;
        newlines are flattened.

    relay inbox
        Print your undelivered messages and mark them delivered. Check it when
        you start and between tasks (messages may have queued while you worked).

    relay msgs [--with <name>] [--project <p>]
        Full message history (delivered + queued).

    relay task add "<title>" [--parent <id>] [--owner <name>] [--spec <path>]
                   [--blocked-by <id,id>] [--project <p>]
        No --parent = an epic. Assigning --owner to someone ELSE queues them
        an automatic wake-up. --spec points at a spec md file.

    relay task update <id> --state todo|doing|blocked|done
        Marking done automatically wakes the owners of tasks that are now
        fully unblocked (all their blockers done).

    relay task list [--project <p>] [--mine]
        Epics with nested subtasks, states, owners, blockers.

    relay spawn --name <name> "<prompt>" [--project <p>] [--dir <path>]
                [--role worker|coordinator]
        Open a new iTerm2 tab running claude, pre-registered under <name>.
